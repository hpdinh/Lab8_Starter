# Lab 8 - Starter
1. Where would you fit your automated tests in your Recipe project development pipeline? Select one of the following and explain why.

I would fit my automated tests within a Github action that runs whenever code is pushed. Using github actions would allow me to automatically run my tests everytime I change my code, which would be more efficient than running them locally.

2. Would you use an end to end test to check if a function is returning the correct output (yes/no)

No, as unit testing would be easier to see output for functions.
